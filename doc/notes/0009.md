Here's a different design; where we move the general purpose function
closer to the code that actually needs it.

In effect, because the I/O implementation is hidden behind the
module boundary, it becomes easier to swap out one implementation
for an alternative.

But in doing that, you get a bit less overlap between the
code invoked via main and the code invoked via test.

Does that dramatically increase the risks?  Probably not
if the "untested" code is simple enough and stable enough.

If the composition had any branching in it (for example, if
we were using command line arguments or environment variables
to make decisions about the assembly) then we would probably
want to arrange things such that the branching logic could
be verified in isolation.

Here, I don't think that's too important.

Practicing on toy problems has a bunch of ideas in tension,
you want things to be as "real" as possible, so that lessons
translate to more complex problems.  On the other hand, if
part of the practice is simplicity, then we shouldn't be
adding elements unnecessarily.

For now, I'm going to go with the design as it sits now,
on the assumption that the boundary concerns are simple
enough that any problems will be easily discovered either
in review or in interactive testing.
