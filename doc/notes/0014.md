There are at least two different ways that we might
check how we are passing arguments to some general
purpose function.

One alternative would be to configure out boundary
adapter with a test double - a mock or a spy that
keeps track of which arguments were passed, and
escalates to a human if those arguments don't
satisfy the specification.

An alternative is to surface those arguments
as values that can be verified via a white box
test, trusting to code inspection and interactive
testing that the resulting behavior is as
expected.

In the case of python keyword arguments, we can
use [locals][1] to fish them out - it loses points
for being clever, but earns some back by being cleaner?

It's not immediately clear to me, when making the
keyword arguments independently verifiable, whether
we should signal that the method is "private" or
public.  In the long run, I'd be happier with
a design that makes it clear that this method is
an artifact of a specific implementation of the
`FlushLines` contract, and not part of that contract.

It might be part of a general adapter-for-print
contract, though.
