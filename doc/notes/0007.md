I started working here toward separating the main module
from the composition of the interactive loop.

But in doing that, I hitched on the signature of the
intermediate method, thinking that I could simplify
things by passing through a dictionary of keyword
arguments.  After all, the intermediate method
isn't doing anything with them of itself.

Looking at that, what I came to realize is that I
needed to look up how to flush output to the console.
And what I found on stack overflow showed that there
were a lot of possible ways to do it.

That in turn tells me a couple things: one, that my mental
model is actually working at a slightly higher level
of abstraction than these general purpose python functions,
and two the decision of which implementation to choose
is something that could be wrong... which is to say
something that we would want to change later.

Another way of saying that is that the parts of the
implementation that know which general purpose methods
we are using, and the code that actually uses those methods
(rather than some higher abstraction), should be "physically"
closer together, rather than further apart.

I'm capturing the code at this point to show the change
in direction.
