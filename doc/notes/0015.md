End of the spike: discard all of that
code, keep the knowledge that's fresh
in your head, use it before you lose it.

I haven't really given a lot of thought
to how design sketching using brain meat
differs from a "spike".

Obviously, I'm keeping the design as
I am sketching it, so that's different.

But sketching has a boundary of a sort,
where my conscience kicks in and announces
that there ought to be a test for that.
