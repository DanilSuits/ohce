Finally, it sinks in that I really do want to have a making
app that shows me that my I/O adapters really do behave
the way that I think that they do.

That gives me a legitimate sandbox to play around in
and extend, rather than temporarily hijacking the
code I'm intending to "ship".

I now have three different concerns (ohce, my smoke test
and the automated tests) that all have very similar needs,
which I think is going to help me to better shape the
module boundaries.

For this exercise, where I'm working with requirements
that are effectively frozen, I think the automated tests
are going to ossify quickly.  But the smoke test or
walking skeleton?  Those I expect to get refactored
as I go along.

The line between "spike" and "interactive smoke test"
may not be particularly sharp.
