To show the change of direction more
clearly, I take it in two steps.

First, I introduce the abstractions that I'm interested in;
the ability to read a single line, and the ability to flush
many lines of output.

But I treat the wiring of these abstractions to the actual
boundary controlled from the outside (ie: passed in from
main).
