As a way of helping to prove that all of this is roughly
working as expected, let's try implementing a simple
echo program; one that reads a single line of input
and repeats that line twice.

```
% bin/ohce.sh
abcde
['abcde', 'abcde']
```

Surprise!  There's a bug.  The general purpose
print function dumps a data structure, and I hadn't
done the formatting of that data structure correctly.

Proper formatting of the output is something that
we should be able to test easily, so that responsibility
does not belong in our boundary implementation.
