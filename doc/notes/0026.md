Another thing I noticed when reviewing the test interface
is that there is potentially a gap in the analysis.

epoch_seconds is a universal time measure; but `ohce`
appears to be using greetings in local time.

If we naively write a test that takes a universal time
input and deterministically produces a localized output,
then either we're likely to end up with offshore
developers complaining about false positives in the
test suite, or offshore customers complaining about bugs.

This can be addressed in a number of ways (specifying a
reference locale for the tests, changing the design so
that we can test using local time affordances).

It's also worth considering that this application
doesn't really care about granularity of time beyond
local morning/afternoon/night, so it might make
sense to use a clock at the boundary that uses this
simplified notion of time.

Which is to say, we probably end up with a library
of fine-grained time conversions, and then get to choose
where in the process flow each of those conversions is applied.

Another riddle of small isolated exercises - we don't
usually get a lot of pressure that favors one design
over another.
