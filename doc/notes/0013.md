Here is an alternative approach, where we allow the code
that knows which underlying general purpose method is
being invoked, and how to leverage that to achieve
the goal.

``` 
% bin/ohce.sh
abcde
fghij
abcde
abcde
fghij
fghij
```

The good news here is that, while we probably won't
budget for extensive testing of our little console
application, lots and lots of eyeballs have already
looked into python's built in print method.

Functionality that we implement "by hand"
in one programming language might be better realized
via library functions in another.  After all, we
chose language X because we thought it had favorable
tradeoffs, we should be leveraging its advantages
as hard as we can without compromising the end result.

This is, to my mind, the sort of thing decision that
out to be part of the decision record of the project.
Future you can review the document to see what alternatives
you were considering (and by negative inference, alternatives
that you may have overlooked).

One? last thing to consider....
