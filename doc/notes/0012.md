Here's an example where a program outputs multiple lines

``` 
% bin/ohce.sh
abcde
fghij
abcde
abcde
fghij
fghij
```

And it produces the result we want.  This is a side effect
of the fact that the `print` function has a parameter `end`
which will be printed when the non keyword arguments are
exhausted.

This implies a different answer to our question about formatting;
that our messages should be messages, and the boundary code
should be responsible for how we present that information on
the boundary.

So the spike continues....
