A simple patch to make the format explicit produces the
correct result

``` 
% bin/ohce.sh
fghij
fghij
fghij
```

But now I'm coming to realize I'm not sure whether this format
is going to work when I output two lines of text.  Do I need
extra line endings?

So we'll extend this "spike" a little further.
