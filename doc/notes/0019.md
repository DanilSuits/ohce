Similar to the pattern used for I/O, we
create an abstraction for reading from
the clock, and confirm that we got it
basically right by integrating it into
the smoke test.

The `epoch_seconds` method is introduced
here to acknowledge the fact that the
floating point representation of time
is tightly coupled to the implementation
choice to use `time.time` as the implementation
of the clock -- using again the argument
that code that needs to be changed in coordination
should be close together.
                       
Contrast this decision with the logic for
formatting in the smoke test -- that's coupled
to the internal decision to pass the epoch
time as an integer.

In the long term, I think what we would normally
see here is the introduction of a value abstraction
for `time`, creating a boundary to protect the
rest of the code from changes to its underlying
data structure.

In the short term: 
 - toy problem
 - not obviously a major risk in the design

So I defer that exploration to avoid getting
lost in the weeds.

Stick it on the checklist to review later,
in case it is important.
