One aspect of the design that we may want to rethink
is the coupling of the I/O loop to time.

To wit, there's no particular reason that the `while`
loop should know that the behavior of the state
machine is time sensitive.

So we can shuffle those responsibilities around a little
bit.

I wouldn't want to get too deep in the weeds here; the
console framework isn't likely to be a key differentiator.
It belongs on the "buy" end of the build vs buy
spectrum - much like we aren't rolling our own I/O
or clock, but are instead using implementation provided
by python.

As a design exercise, it's fine -- but as we begin to imagine
a richer feature set in the presentation layer itself, we'd
probably want to look into whether we could find something
off the shelf to get us most of the way there.
