Note: at this point in the process, I'm still relying heavily
on brain meat to pick my way through choices in the design,
rather than capturing those choices in code and mucking
about with them.

Automated mistake detectors are not the only way
of controlling the gap between decision and feedback.

Thinking, as an alternative, is not without its downsides;
it's transient, vs something that can be checked into
source control.  It's subjective.  It's somewhat speculative.

On the other hand, one of the affordances of brain meat
is _judgment_, which should not be underrated.
