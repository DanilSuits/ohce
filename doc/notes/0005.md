In thinking about the claim that `main()` is "so simple
there are obviously no deficiencies", it occurred to
me that the connasence of the design wasn't all that it
could be.

In theory, there is some logical motivation for priority
of the positional arguments, and everybody using that
same theory and logic would be able to guess which
arguments go where.

But I'm not quite sure that I buy that as a universal.
Keyword arguments are not a lot more effort, and might
reduce mistakes down the road.

In doing that it occurred to me that we can use the
variable names to communicate to ourselves in the
future what sort of representation of time we actually
mean.

Consider: if we're just going to pass `print`, then the
code that receives it will need to understand how to
use that method to flush the buffer.  Our test controls,
working at this level, need to match these general
purpose interfaces _in all of the aspects that the
test subject needs_.

And that's fine - providing that we can arrange for
most of the testing to happen via protocols that
operate at a higher semantic level.

In other words, this design is intended to permit
testing with low level controls, but it's not expected
that that would be the primary testing strategy.

That should reduce the amount of damage if we later
need to introduce a different abstraction of the
boundary layer itself.
