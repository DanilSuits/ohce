# Introduction

I'm experimenting with OHCE at the suggestion of [@DavidRooN3y][1]

OHCE appears to be original to [Manual Rivero][2] (2016-05-18). 
There is a [gist][3], and also a number of [github repositories][4]
 
```
ohce is a console application that echoes the reverse of what you input through the console.
```
