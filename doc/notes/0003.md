A primary difference between the production
version of our code and the subjects of our
tests is the configuration of the boundary code.

Here, that boundary is I/O and the clock.

If we want to maximize the amount of "real"
code that can be exercised in automated checks, 
then we should push the configuration of the
boundary as close to the root of the program
as possible.

That's not the only choice, of course - you
might keep the configuration a little bit
deeper in the program hierarchy, "hiding"
some of the boundary elements from each
other.
