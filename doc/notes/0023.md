Proof of how often I'm running my automated
checks during the sketching phase: I only
just now discovered that my interactive smoke
tests were being run as part of my automated
test suite.

Whoops.

Also perhaps worth noticing that when I discovered
that error, my implementation was still satisfying
my (very few) automated checks.
