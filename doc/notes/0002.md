# Analysis
           
OHCE is an interactive console application.  It looks as
though everything is single threaded.

The program should loop until it recognizes some terminating
condition, then exit.  On each iteration of the loop, it
reads a single line of input text from the console, then outputs
one or more lines of response.

There doesn't appear to be any sort of concern for exit codes, or
running the program in a non-interactive mode where it responds
to prompts piped into the program.

In addition to I/O, some of the output messages are clock dependent.
                                       
The program instructions leave some wiggle room about how time is
handled internally - "depending on the current time" could mean depending
on time at construction, time at startup, or time at prompt.

So there's some room for variation there, and you might want to
consider whether the interface between the I/O aware parts of the
program and the rest should be a simple contract that satisfies
exactly one choice, or a more implicated interface that can support 
different choices.
