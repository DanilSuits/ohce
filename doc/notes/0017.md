A first developer test, to ensure that the data structure
for the formatting of FlushLines is correct.

It's probably important to review the limits of this test;
because it is using the dictionary of formatting arguments
as a sort of proxy measure "is the output going to look
right?"

It's a low value test for a few reasons.

When we look at the details of the function in question,
we see that the check is really just evaluating whether
we typed the same value in both places.

It doesn't actually connect these keywords to the set
used by print; we're basically relying on human review.

We don't expect this code to change very much in the
future (vs being ripped out and replaced with some
other implementation of the same contract).

If `print` were to change in a backwards incompatible
way, either by renaming its arguments or interpreting
them differently, this test would not detect the
problem.

It's really only likely to be important (briefly) if
we later discover that there is a super sexy way to
more directly couple these arguments to those used
by `print`.
