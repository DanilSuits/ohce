The isolated finite state machine is testable.  We
can start adding in automated checks to measure its
outputs in different circumstances.

With the functions in place, we can also use this
implementation as part of our application.

`ohce` is working!  Although obviously it isn't ready
to ship -- too many of the requirements are unmet.
But at this point it is really just an exercise in
filling the missing state and logic into the state machine
component.

And that we can do via the familiar red/green/refactor
protocol.
