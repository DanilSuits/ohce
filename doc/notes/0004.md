Choosing `input`, `print`, and `time.time` as the outermost
boundary layer is arbitrary; I'm guessing that each
of those is fundamental enough that a simple program like
ohce can be constructed from this boundary.

It might be a useful exercise to build out a working instance
of ohce, and then change these fundamentals and explore
how disruptive that is to the overall design.

Information hiding principles suggest that the impact
of such a change should be limited.

Key idea in this design; although `main()` is tightly
coupled to the real boundary, `Main.run()` can be invoked
using test controls rather than boundary functions,
giving us the seam we want if automated checking at this 
level of the program has value.

We would presumably use an interactive strategy
for testing `main()`; a human operator working through
interesting scenarios.  From the perspective of automated
checks, however, this part of the solution clearly
falls into the "so simple there are obviously no deficiencies".
