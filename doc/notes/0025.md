It becomes apparent really quickly that passing the time
with the input line is... kind of clumsy, especially as
only the `ohce` command actually cares about the timestamp.

Some things to consider:

Sticking an adapter into the test framework isn't
necessarily a cheat - because the interactive loop
is actually communicating with the FSM via an adapter
as well.

We could, of course, introduce a default value for
the `now` argument, ignoring it when it doesn't matter
and inducing some arbitrary behavior when an `ohce`
command arrives without an explicit timestamp.

Another possibility would be to use some flavor of
"factory" to create messages, where that factory
is itself connected directly to the boundary.  For
example, we could implement an inert message factory,
that always produce messages for some fixed time
of day, and a "live" version of that same factory
that looks up the epoch seconds.

If you look carefully, this is just our adapter pattern
again - live and inert facades sitting in front of a
general purpose implementation that accepts time as
an input.

This sort of design also shuffles about which
parts of the implementation are aware of the clock
dependence.
